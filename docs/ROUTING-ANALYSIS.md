# Routing Configuration Analysis

## Issues Found

### 1. ❌ Gateway Address Configuration (CRITICAL)
The production gateway patch incorrectly sets:
```yaml
addresses:
- type: Hostname
  value: scavenger-hunt.linsmeyer.com
```

**Problem**: This tells the Gateway to bind to a hostname instead of an IP address. The Gateway needs to bind to all addresses or a specific IP, not a hostname.

**Fix**: Remove the addresses field entirely to let the LoadBalancer handle it automatically.

### 2. ✅ HTTPRoute Hostnames (Correct)
The production patches correctly update hostnames:
- Backend: `scavenger-hunt.linsmeyer.com`, `api.scavenger-hunt.linsmeyer.com`
- Admin: `scavenger-hunt.linsmeyer.com`, `admin.scavenger-hunt.linsmeyer.com`
- Player: `scavenger-hunt.linsmeyer.com`, `play.scavenger-hunt.linsmeyer.com`

### 3. ✅ Route Paths (Correct)
- `/api/*` → backend service
- `/admin/*` → admin service (with URL rewrite)
- `/health` → backend service
- `/socket.io/*` → backend service (WebSocket)
- `/` → player service (catch-all)

### 4. ✅ Service References (Correct)
All backend service references use the correct names:
- `backend` on port 80
- `admin` on port 80
- `player` on port 80

### 5. ⚠️ HTTPS Redirect Issue
The HTTPS redirect only applies to the base hostname, not wildcards. It should include all subdomains.

## Root Cause
The empty responses are likely caused by the Gateway trying to bind to a hostname (`scavenger-hunt.linsmeyer.com`) instead of an IP address. This prevents the Gateway from receiving any traffic.

## Required Fixes

### Fix 1: Remove Gateway Address Configuration
Already applied - removed the incorrect addresses field from the production gateway patch.

### Fix 2: Verify NGINX Gateway Controller
The controller must be running and watching for Gateway resources. Check with:
```bash
kubectl get pods -n nginx-gateway
kubectl logs -n nginx-gateway -l app=nginx-gateway
```

### Fix 3: Check Gateway Status
After deployment, verify the Gateway is programmed:
```bash
kubectl get gateway -n scavenger-hunt-prod scavenger-hunt-gateway
kubectl describe gateway -n scavenger-hunt-prod scavenger-hunt-gateway
```

Look for:
- Status: Programmed
- Addresses: Should show the LoadBalancer IP

## Testing After Fix

1. Deploy the fixed configuration
2. Wait for Gateway to be programmed
3. Test routes:
   ```bash
   curl http://scavenger-hunt.linsmeyer.com/health
   curl http://scavenger-hunt.linsmeyer.com/api/health
   curl http://scavenger-hunt.linsmeyer.com/
   ```

## Alternative Issues

If the fix doesn't work, check:

1. **NGINX Gateway Fabric Version**: Ensure it supports Gateway API v1
2. **Service Type**: The NGINX Gateway service must be type LoadBalancer
3. **Firewall Rules**: Port 80/443 must be open on the LoadBalancer
4. **Pod Status**: All application pods must be running
